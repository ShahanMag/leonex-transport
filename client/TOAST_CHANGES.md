Replaced all `alert()` calls with **Sonner toast notifications** and modal confirmations for a better user experience.

## Changes Made

### 1. Dependencies Added
- **Package**: `sonner@^1.7.4`
- **Install**: `npm install sonner`

### 2. Configuration
- Added `Toaster` component to `App.jsx`
- Positioned at top-right with rich colors enabled
- Auto-dismiss toasts with smooth animations

### 3. Toast Utility Created
**File**: `src/utils/toast.js`

Functions:
```javascript
showSuccess(message)      // Green toast for successful actions
showError(message)        // Red toast for errors
showInfo(message)         // Blue toast for info
showWarning(message)      // Yellow toast for warnings
showConfirm(message, onConfirm)  // Custom modal for confirmations
```
